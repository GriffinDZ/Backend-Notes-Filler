Google Apps Script that helps transfer data from a specific Google Form's spreadsheet to a formatted Google Doc. 

Created for a theatre (https://www.facebook.com/behindthezioncurtaincabaret/) to automate the process of transferring data from a Google Form to a Google Doc.

The code works based on the organization's specific set up of their Google Forms. It allows the user to easily select the desired spreadsheet to run the 
script on, as well as the template to insert the data into.
